# iTunesRPC-Remastered

A fork of [https://github.com/claythearc/iTunesRPC](claythearc's iTunesRP repo) remastered to be a bit more feature rich.
Inspired by [https://github.com/nint8835/iTunesRichPresence](nint8835's iTunesRichPresence).

## IMPORTANT NOTE
To get the project to work, you must make an application in the [https://discord.com/developers/applications](Discord Developer Portal) and copy the
application ID into a file named "secret" without quotation marks.

Original Features:
