# iTunesRPC-Remastered

A fork of (https://github.com/claythearc/iTunesRPC)[claythearc's iTunesRPC repo] remastered to be a bit more feature rich.
Inspired by (nint8835's iTunesRichPresence)[https://github.com/nint8835/iTunesRichPresence].

## IMPORTANT NOTE
To get the project to work, you must make an application in the (Discord Developer Portal)[https://discord.com/developers/applications] and copy the
application ID into a file named "secret" without quotation marks.

Original Features:
