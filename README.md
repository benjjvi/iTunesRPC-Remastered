# iTunesRPC-Remastered

A fork of [claythearc's iTunesRPC repo](https://github.com/claythearc/iTunesRPC) remastered to be a bit more feature rich.
Inspired by [nint8835's iTunesRichPresence repo](https://github.com/nint8835/iTunesRichPresence).

## IMPORTANT NOTE
To get the project to work, you must make an application in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and copy the
application ID into a file named "secret" without quotation marks.

Original Features:
1. Shows currently playing song
2. Shows songs artist
3. Shows time left


New Features:
1. Paused message
2. Album Artwork (limited due to discord API)
