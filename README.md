# iTunesRPC-Remastered

A fork of [claythearc's iTunesRPC repo](https://github.com/claythearc/iTunesRPC) remastered to be a bit more feature rich.
Inspired by [nint8835's iTunesRichPresence repo](https://github.com/nint8835/iTunesRichPresence).

## IMPORTANT NOTE
To get the project to work, you must make an application in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and copy the
application ID into a file named "secret" without quotation marks.

Original Features:
Shows currently playing song
Shows songs artist
Shows time left

New Features:
Paused message
Album Artwork (limited due to discord API)
